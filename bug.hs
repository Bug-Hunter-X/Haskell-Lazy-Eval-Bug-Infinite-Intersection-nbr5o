This Haskell code suffers from a subtle bug related to lazy evaluation and infinite lists:

```haskell
import Data.List (intersect)

findCommon :: [Int] -> [Int] -> Maybe Int
findCommon xs ys = listToMaybe (xs `intersect` ys)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let common = findCommon [1..] [1000..]  -- Bug: Infinite list intersection
  print common
```

The `intersect` function uses lazy evaluation, meaning it only calculates elements as needed. However,  `[1..]` and `[1000..]` are infinite lists.  `intersect` attempts to compare elements from both lists until a common element is found. But since both lists are infinite, this comparison never completes, resulting in the program hanging indefinitely.
